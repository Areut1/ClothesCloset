# SUNY Brockport Clothes Closet

This is our final project from Object-Oriented Software Development (CSC429). It is a JavaFX application interacting with 
a backend SQL database found at 'csdb.brockport.edu'. There are different abstractions used in this project.

Any front-end screens are created inside the `userinterface` module, and each of them work with a corresponding
transaction class found inside the `model` module.

Making JavaFX work is pain - good luck!
